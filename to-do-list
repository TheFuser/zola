Let's say I have the following code:
```Python
user_input=input("Country that has this flag:")
actual_answer="antarctica"
```
If user_input="antartica", so almost correct, I'd like that the bot prints "Almost there"? Is there a way to do that, maybe other than regular expressions and pattern searching?
